In the context of the Secure Online Banking System project, the following .NET Core MVC architectural models could be utilized:

### 1\. Three-Tier Architecture

The three-tier architecture model is suitable for a secure online banking system because it separates the system into three distinct tiers:

1.  **Presentation Layer (Client Tier)**: This layer manages the user interface and handles user interaction. In a .NET Core MVC application, this would be the Controllers and Views.
    
2.  **Business Logic Layer (Application Tier)**: This layer contains the business logic, which controls the application's functionality by performing detailed processing. In .NET Core MVC, this would be represented by the Controllers and Models.
    
3.  **Data Access Layer (Data Tier)**: This layer includes the data access functionalities and helps in performing CRUD operations. In .NET Core MVC, this would be handled by Entity Framework Core or other ORMs.
    

### 2\. Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is an abstraction layer that you put on your data access layer. It helps to separate the business logic from the data access logic, which in turn provides a cleaner codebase and easier testing and maintenance.

### 3\. Unit of Work Pattern

The Unit of Work pattern is a way to group one or more operations (like reading, inserting, updating, deleting) into a single transaction, ensuring that all operations are either completed successfully or not executed at all. In the context of a banking application, this would be essential to prevent data inconsistencies and maintain system reliability.

### 4\. Dependency Injection Pattern

Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique where an object receives other objects that it depends on. .NET Core includes built-in support for dependency injection, which can be used to provide services that your controllers or other services need.

### 5\. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The MVC design pattern separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. .NET Core MVC uses this pattern by default. It helps in separating the business logic, user interface, and control flow into different components, making it easier to manage and test the application.

### 6\. Security Design Patterns

Given the nature of the project, it's crucial to consider patterns like Identity Management for User Authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Access Control, the use of SSL/TLS for Secure Communication, and the use of Data Protection API (DPAPI) for Data Encryption.

Finally, it's important to note that these are architectural patterns. The specific models or algorithms to be used for encryption, authentication, and other security measures will depend on the chosen libraries and tools, and they should be chosen based on the latest security standards and industry best practices.

In an online banking system, a clean, user-friendly and intuitive User Interface (UI) is essential. Here's a list of essential UI components for each user role:

### 1\. Customer/User Interface:

*   **Login/Register**: Users should have screens for login and registration. These pages should be secure and robust, with features like captcha, two-factor authentication, and forgot password functionality.
    
*   **Dashboard**: Once logged in, users should be directed to a dashboard page showing a summary of their account(s), including account balances, recent transactions, and any notifications or alerts.
    
*   **Account Details**: Users should be able to click on an account from their dashboard and view more detailed information, such as full transaction history.
    
*   **Fund Transfer**: Users should have the ability to transfer funds between their own accounts, or to other users' accounts. This screen should include input validation to prevent incorrect transfers.
    
*   **Profile Management**: Users should be able to view and edit their profile details, including contact information, password changes, and security settings.
    
*   **Logout**: Users should be able to securely log out from the system.
    

### 2\. Administrator Interface:

*   **Login**: Administrators should have a separate, secure login page.
    
*   **Dashboard**: The admin dashboard could show a variety of system overviews, such as the number of active users, transaction volumes, or system alerts.
    
*   **User Management**: Administrators should be able to view, create, edit, or deactivate user accounts.
    
*   **Transaction Management**: Administrators should have the ability to view all transactions, reverse transactions, or manually create new transactions.
    
*   **Audit Logs**: Administrators should be able to view audit logs, which record all important user activities within the system.
    
*   **System Management**: Administrators should have tools for managing the banking system, such as modifying interest rates or fees, sending system notifications, or managing system security settings.
    
*   **Logout**: Administrators should be able to securely log out from the system.
    

Both interfaces should be responsive and designed in a way to work seamlessly across different device types and screen sizes. Each screen should have proper error messages and user guidance to provide a good user experience.
